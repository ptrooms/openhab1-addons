How to configure your device itself.
Simple version is to just configure the mac adress. The item is considered to be a switch, which than is ON or OFF.
Following example creates a binding to edmiax for device with MAC: 01234567ABCD.
Example: Switch EdimaxSimple {edimax="01234567ABCD"}

Also the Password to the device is configurable. The following example creates a device with password '1234'.
Example: {edimax="01234567ABCD:1234"}

There is also the option to configure the type, currently available types are STATE,POWER and CURRENT.
STATE is the default. POWER for example assumes a number item and will show the power consumption of the device.
Example: Number EdimaxCurrent  {edimax="01234567ABCD:1234:CURRENT"}
